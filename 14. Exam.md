## Exercise 1
**(3p)**  

## Quiz questions (justifications required):

&emsp; 1. The following historical data sets describe the evolution of the average monthly gross nominal wage and of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Romania during the years 2012-2018:  

| | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Average monthly gross nominal wage (&euro;) | 2063 | 2163 | 2328 | 2555 | 2809 | 3223 | 3457 |
| CPI | 103.3 | 104.0 | 101.1 | 94.4 | 98.5 | 101.3 | 104.6 |

&emsp; Identify which statement is false:  
&emsp;&emsp; (a) in 2017 the increase of the nominal gross wage compared to the previous year was of $414$ &euro; (ie about $14.7\%$)  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) in the period 2012-2018 the largest annual increase in prices was registered in 2018  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) in all the years 2012-2018 the real value of the average gross wage was lower than the nominal one  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) the inflation rate in 2014 was $1.1\%$  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(c)** because in some years, the CPI goes below 100, indicating a lower real value, and in some years, the CPI goes above 100, indicating a higher real value. Not all the values are lower.  

---

&emsp; 2. In case of an IS-LM model, an increase in autonomous taxes will make:  

&emsp;&emsp; (a) IS shift to the right  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) IS rotate to the left  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) LM shift to the left  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) none of the above  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(d)**, as IS shifts to the left when autonomous taxes increase:

---

&emsp; 3. In a closed economy the propensity of consumption is $c = 0.9$ and the tax rate $t = 0.3$. A decrease in the government expenditures by 10 bil. &euro; will lead to a change in GDP by about:  

&emsp;&emsp; (a) -27 bil. &euro;  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) 27 bil. &euro;  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) -50 bil. &euro;  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) 50 bil. &euro;  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(a)** because of the following calculations:  
&emsp; $\Delta y = \dfrac{1}{1 - c \cdot (1 - t)} \cdot \Delta G$  
&emsp; $\Delta y = \dfrac{1}{1 - 0.9 \cdot (1 - 0.3)} \cdot -10$  
&emsp; $\Delta y = 2.7 \cdot -10 = -27$  

---

&emsp; 4. In case of a flexible exchange rate and a weak capital mobility, a decrease of the nominal exchange rate lei/€ from 4.85 to 4.7 leads to:  

&emsp;&emsp; (a) a depreciation of the national currency  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) an increase of exports  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) an increase of the trade deficit  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) a decrease of the balance of payments deficit  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(a)** because it takes fewer lei to purchase one &euro;, this implies that the leu currency has depreciated in value relative to &euro;.  

---

&emsp; 5. The amount of the fixed capital depreciation is not part of the following macroeconomic indicator:  

&emsp;&emsp; (a) GNP  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) GFCF (Gross fixed capital formation)  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) GDP  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) NNP  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(d)** because NNP (net national product) is GNP minus depreciation and amortization.

---

&emsp; 6. Given that the annual nominal interest rate is 2% and the CPI for the same year is 101.5%, the real interest rate is:  

&emsp;&emsp; (a) $0.5\%$  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) $1.97\%$  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) $-0.5\%$  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) $3.5\%$  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(a)** because of the following calculations:  
&emsp; $IR = NIR - (CPI - 1)$  
&emsp; $IR = 0.02 - (1.05 - 1) = 0.02 - 0.05$  
&emsp; $IR = 0.005 = 0.5\%$  

---

&emsp; 7. Okun's law states that:  

&emsp;&emsp; (a) if the real GDP increases by $2.5\%$, the unemployment rate decreases by $0.75\%$  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) if the unemployment rate increases by $2.5\%$, the inflation rate will decrease  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) if the unemployment rate increases by $2.5\%$, the economic growth will be negative  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) if the inflation rate increases by $2.5\%$, the supply of goods decreases by $2.75\%$  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(c)** because Okun's Law shows the link between real economic growth and changes in the unemployment rate. Unemployment rises in each recession.

---

&emsp; 8. In an IS-LM model the propensity of consumption is $c = 0.75$, the tax rate is $t = 0.2$, $b = 1000$, $k = 0.3$ and $h = 500$. Identify the correct relation, where $\alpha _G$ represents the multiplier of government expenditures on the
goods and services market, while $\Gamma _{BP}$ and $\Gamma _{MP}$ are the multipliers of budgetary and monetary policy respectively for the IS-LM model:

&emsp;&emsp; (a) $\Gamma _{MP} > \Gamma _{BP} > \alpha _G$  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) $\Gamma _{MP} > \alpha _G > \Gamma _{BP}$  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) $\alpha _G > \Gamma _{BP} > \Gamma _{MP}$  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) $\alpha _G > \Gamma _{MP} > \Gamma _{BP}$  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(d)** because of the following calculations:  
&emsp; $\Gamma _{BP} = \dfrac{1}{1 - c \cdot (1 - t) + \dfrac{b \cdot k}{h}} = \dfrac{1}{1 - 0.75 \cdot (1 - 0.2) + \dfrac{1000 \cdot 0.3}{500}}$  
&emsp; $\Gamma _{BP} = 1$  
&emsp; $\Gamma _{MP} = \dfrac{1}{1 - c \cdot (1 - t) + \dfrac{b \cdot k}{h}} \cdot \dfrac{b}{h} = \dfrac{1}{1 - 0.75 \cdot (1 - 0.2) + \dfrac{1000 \cdot 0.3}{500}} \cdot \dfrac{1000}{500}$  
&emsp; $\Gamma _{MP} = 2$  
&emsp; $\alpha _G = \dfrac{1}{1 - c \cdot (1 - t)} = \dfrac{1}{1 - 0.75 \cdot ( 1- 0.2)}$  
&emsp; $\alpha _G = 2.5$  
&emsp; As such, $\alpha _G > \Gamma _{MP} > \Gamma _{BP}$  

---

&emsp; 9. The changes in inventories represent:  

&emsp;&emsp; (a) a leading indicator of business cycles  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) a lagging indicator of business cycles  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) a coincident indicator of business cycles  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) none of the above  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(c)** because changes in inventories reflect the current state of the economy as businesses adjust their stock levels in response to changes in demand.

---

&emsp; 10. The income obtained by an Italian working in a Romanian company is part of:

&emsp;&emsp; (a) the Romanian GNP and the Italian GDP  
&emsp;&emsp; (b) the Romanian GNP and the Italian GNP  
&emsp;&emsp; (c) the Romanian GDP and the Italian GNP  
&emsp;&emsp; (d) none of the above  

&emsp; The correct answer is **(c)** because the individual is working in Romania, their income would be part of the Romanian GDP, but since the individual is an Italian national, their income would also contribute to the Italian GNP.

## Exercise 2
**(4.5p)**

*Consider the case of an open economy, described by the IS-LM-BP model, for which we know the following:*
- $C _0 = 215$ mil. &euro;

- $Tr = 120$ mil. &euro;
- $G = 540$ mil. &euro;
- $I _0 = 270$ mil. &euro;
- $\dfrac{M}{p} = 400$ mil. &euro;
- $NX _0 = 350$ mil. &euro;
- $c = 0.75$
- $t = 0.12 = 12\%$
- $b = 200$
- $k = 0.25$
- $h = 400$
- $m = 0.16$
- $n = 0$

(a)  
The model (market for G&S):  
&emsp; $y = C + I + G + NX$  
&emsp; $C = C _0 + c \cdot y ^D$  
&emsp; $y ^D = y - T + Tr$  
&emsp; $T = T _0 + t \cdot y$  
&emsp; $I = I _0 - b \cdot r$  
&emsp; $G = \overline G$  
&emsp; $NX = NX _0 - m \cdot y$  

The model (monetary market):  
&emsp; $\dfrac{M^S}{p} = \dfrac{M}{p}$  
&emsp; $\dfrac{M^D}{p} = k \cdot y - h \cdot r$  
&emsp; $CF = n \cdot r$  

$IS$ analytically:  
&emsp; $y = C _0 + c \cdot (y - T _0 - t \cdot y + Tr) + I _0 - b \cdot r + G + NX _0 - m \cdot y$  
&emsp; $y - c \cdot y \cdot (1 - t) + m \cdot y = C _0 - c \cdot T _0 + c \cdot Tr + I _ 0 - b \cdot r + G + NX _ 0$  
&emsp; $y = \dfrac{1}{1 - c \cdot (1 - t) + m} \cdot (C _ 0 - c \cdot T _ 0 + c \cdot Tr + I _0 - b \cdot r + G + NX _0)$  

$IS$ numerically:  
&emsp; $y = \dfrac{1}{1 - 0.75 \cdot (1 - 0.12) + 016} \cdot (215 - 0.75 \cdot 220 + 0.75 \cdot 120 + 270 - 200 \cdot r + 540 + 350)$  
&emsp; $y = 2600 - 400 \cdot r$  


$LM$ analytically:  
&emsp; $\dfrac{M^S}{p} = \dfrac{M}{p}$  
&emsp; $\dfrac{M^D}{p} = k \cdot y - h \cdot r$  
&emsp; $\Rightarrow \dfrac{M}{p} = k \cdot y - h \cdot r$  
&emsp; $y = \dfrac{1}{k} \cdot \dfrac{M}{p} + \dfrac{h}{k} \cdot r$  

$LM$ numerically:  
&emsp; $y = \dfrac{1}{0.25} \cdot 400 + \dfrac{400}{0.25} \cdot r$  
&emsp; $y = 1600 \cdot (r + 1)$  

$BP$ analytically:  
&emsp; $NX = CF$  
&emsp; $NX _0 - m \cdot y = \underset{=0}{n} \cdot r$  
&emsp; $NX _0 - m \cdot y = 0$  
&emsp; $\Rightarrow y = \dfrac{NX _0}{m}$  

$BP$ numerically:  
&emsp; $y = \dfrac{350}{0.16} = 2187.5$

(b)  
&emsp; $\dfrac{M^D}{p} = k \cdot y - h \cdot r$

## Exercise 3
**(1.5p)**  

When President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, the economy was suffering from a significant recession. The president proposed a sizable stimulus package to increase aggregate demand. The package cost the federal government about $5\%$ of annual GDP and included some tax cuts and higher transfer payments, but much of it was made up of increases in government purchases of goods and services.

(a)  
&emsp; Based on the Keynesian theory and the IS-LM model, the macroeconomic effects expected to be achieved through President Obama's stimulus package were:

1. Increase in Aggregate Demand: The increase in government purchases of goods and services would directly increase the aggregate demand in the economy. This increase in spending would lead to higher output and employment levels.

2. Fiscal Multiplier Effect: By injecting funds into the economy, the stimulus package aimed to create a multiplier effect. According to Keynesian theory, an increase in government spending would have a greater impact on aggregate demand than the initial increase itself. This is because the increased spending would circulate through the economy, generating income and consumption, which in turn would lead to further increases in demand.

3. Stabilizing the Economy: The stimulus package aimed to mitigate the negative effects of the recession by stabilizing the economy. By increasing government purchases, it sought to offset the decline in private sector spending and investment. This stabilization would help prevent a further downturn in output and employment.

(b)  
&emsp; The effectiveness of Obama's policy in this business cycle phase can be seen as relatively successful. The stimulus package provided a boost to the economy and helped it recover from the severe recession. Several indicators suggest the policy had a positive impact:

1. Output and Employment: The stimulus package contributed to an increase in aggregate demand, leading to higher output levels. It helped stimulate economic activity and prevent a deeper contraction. Employment levels gradually improved, although the recovery was gradual and took time.

2. Economic Growth: The stimulus package played a role in supporting economic growth. It helped stabilize the economy and prevent a prolonged period of economic decline. The package contributed to a rebound in GDP growth and helped restore confidence in the economy.

3. Financial Market Stabilization: The policy measures, including tax cuts and higher transfer payments, helped alleviate the financial stress faced by households and businesses. This stabilization reduced the risk of further disruptions in the financial markets and contributed to an overall recovery.

&emsp; However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of the policy is subject to debate and depends on various factors. The magnitude and timing of the stimulus, as well as other policy measures and external factors, can influence the outcomes.
