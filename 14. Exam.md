## Exercise 2

*Consider the case of an open economy, described by the IS-LM-BP model, for which we know the following:*
- $C _0 = 215$ mil. &euro;
- $T _0 = 220$ mil. &euro;
- $Tr = 120$ mil. &euro;
- $G = 540$ mil. &euro;
- $I _0 = 270$ mil. &euro;
- $\dfrac{M}{p} = 400$ mil. &euro;
- $NX _0 = 350$ mil. &euro;
- $c = 0.75$
- $t = 0.12 = 12\%$
- $b = 200$
- $k = 0.25$
- $h = 400$
- $m = 0.16$
- $n = 0$

Determine:  
&emsp; (a) the $IS$, $LM$ and $BP$ equations both analytically and numerically  
&emsp; (b) The equilibrium point ($y ^ *$, $r ^ *$), $C$, $I$, $NX$, $T$ and the budgetary deficit ($BD$)  
&emsp; (c) The budgetary policy multiplier $\Gamma _{BP}$ and the monetary policy $\Gamma _{MP}$ multiplier  
&emsp; (d) The effect of an increase in autonomous taxes by 20 mil. &euro; ($\Delta T _ 0 = 20$) upon the initial equilibrium point (analytical, numerical and graphical)  
&emsp; (e) The change in the government spending ($\Delta G = ?$) required to reduce the budgetary deficit by $10$ mil. &euro;  
&emsp; (f) The effect of a drop in the tax rate with $0.02$ ($\Delta t= -0.02$) upon the initial equilibrium point (analytical, numerical and graphical)  
&emsp; (g) The effects of a mixed policy to increase both transfers by $50$ mil. &euro; and the real money supply by $50$ mil. &euro; ($\Delta Tr = 50$, $\Delta \dfrac{M}{p} = 50$) on the initial equilibrium point, comment the results
