## <ins>Types of economic sectors
1. households 🏠
2. firms 🏢
3. government 🏛️
4. foreign sector

## <ins>Types of markets
1. Goods & Services market 💹
2. factors markets (labour, land, capital), **but not for entrepreneurship** 💸
3. monetary market 💵

## <ins>Types of factors of production
1. labour $\Rightarrow$ **reward: wage** $\Rightarrow$ full-time, part-time, temporary workers 👷
2. land $\Rightarrow$ **reward: rent** $\Rightarrow$ land & gifts of nature, like mining (coal, petrol), agriculture, fish, etc. ⛽🐟
    > Raw materials are transacted on the commodity markets
3. capital $\Rightarrow$ **reward: interest** $\Rightarrow$ all manufactured markets that aid production plants, assembly lines, machines, infrastructures (communication, railways), etc. 📻🚂🏭
4. managerial skills $\Rightarrow$ **reward: profit** $\Rightarrow$ entrepreneurship 🧑‍💼

## <ins>Other factors of production
- knowledge (skills, expertise) 📕
- state of technology 🧪
- social capital (cohesion of the society, trust in legal systems) 💶
- cultural heritage 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

To perform macroeconomic analysis we need to use:
- Data (provided by trusted source: NIS, NBR, Eurostat, WorldBank) 
- Nominal values **(current prices)** vs real values **(comparable prices)**
- $\text{Wage} _\text{real}=\dfrac{\text{Wage} _\text{nominal}}{\text{CPI}}$
- $\text{GDP} _\text{real}=\dfrac{\text{GDP} _\text{nominal}}{\text{GDP} _\text{deflator}}$

## Absolute vs relative values
- absolute values:
  - $\Delta_y^{t/t_0}=y_t-y_{t_0}$ *(fixed-base absolute value)*
  - $\Delta_y^{t/t-1}=y_t-y_{t-1}$ *(chain absolute value)*
  - Index numbers:
    - $I_y^{t/t_0}=\dfrac{y_t}{y_{t0}}*100$ *(fixed base index)*
    - $I_y^{t/t-1}=\dfrac{y_t}{y_{t-1}}*100$ *(chain index)*
    - $I_y = \sqrt[t]{\dfrac{y_t}{y_{t_0}}}*100$ *(average index)*
- relative values:
  - $\Delta _y^{t/t-1}=\dfrac{y _t-y _{t-1}}{y _{t-1}}*100$
  - $r_y = I_y - 100$ *(economic growth)*

## Models
### <ins>Consider the case of a closed economy **without** government sector
- in terms of revenue allocation:
  - $y = C + S$ $\Rightarrow$ **(1)**
  > $y$ = national income  
  > $C$ = consumption  
  > $S$ = savings  
- in terms of demand:
  - $y = C + I$ $\Rightarrow$ **(2)**
  > $y$ = natural product  
  > $C$ = consumption  
  > $I$ = investment  

From **(1)** and **(2)** $\Rightarrow$ $C + S = C + I = S = I$

---

### <ins>Consider the case of a closed economy **with** government sector
- we have to include:
  - gov spending
  - taxes
  - subsidies
  - transfers
- $GDP_{mp} = C + I + G$
> $GDP_{mp}$ = GDP in market prices  
> $C$ = consumption  
> $I$ = investment  
> $G$ = gov. spending  
- $GDP_{fp} = GDP_{mp} - T_{ind} + S_v$
> $GDP_{fp}$ = GDP in factor prices  
> $T_{ind}$ = indirect taxes  
> $S_v$ = subsidies  
- $y^D = GDP_{fp} - T_{dir} + T_r$
> $y^D$ = disposable income  
> $T_{dir}$ = indirect taxes  
> $T_r$ = transfers
