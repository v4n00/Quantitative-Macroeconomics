## <ins>The basic economic (the classic economic problem)

-   unlimited needs (food, water, shelter, health care, education) 🍔💧
-   unlimited wants  
    **VS**
-   limited resources

## <ins>Opportunity cost (OC)

Is the loss of other alternatives when one alternative is chosen.  
Examples:

1. consumer budget: 7000 RON
    1. <ins>1x Macbook Pro</ins> _(7000 RON)_ 💻
    2. 2x Lenovo _(3500 RON/each)_ &larr; OC 💻💻
2. IT company budget: 1 mil. €
    1. <ins>Project B (best profit)</ins>
    2. Project C (moderate profit) &larr; OC
    3. ~~Project A (low profit)~~
        > When we have multiple choices the OC becomes the next best alternative
3. government:
    1. <ins>import vaccine 💉
    2. produce vaccine &larr; OC

## <ins>Common questions

1. What **goods and services** to produce?
2. How to produce these **goods and services**?
3. For whom do we produces **goods and services**?
    - only those who afford to pay the price or everyone?
    - government: redistribute income and wealth (progressive taxation)

## <ins>Types of economic systems

### 1. market (free) economy

-   pure: no government at all 🚫
-   productive resources are owned by firms
-   consumer sovereignty
-   market forces of **demand and supply**:
    -   invisible hand 🤚
    -   price mechanism 🪙
    -   high **demand** and low **supply** $\Rightarrow$ **price** $\nearrow$ $\Rightarrow$ signaling that more productive resources should be used to produce more $\Rightarrow$ supply $\nearrow$
-   firms want max profits 🤑
-   consumers want max utility 😊

### 2. Planned (command) economy

-   government owns most productive resources
-   state enterprises 🏛️
-   central planners 👷
    -   they plan ahead
    -   they decide what goods and services (and in what quantities) to produce
    -   they set the price for most (basic) goods at low levels
    -   low levels $\Rightarrow$ shortages which leads:
        -   queues
        -   black markets
-   government wants max social welfare

### 3. Mixed economies

-   most of the countries are Mixed
-   Singapore is the closest to free
-   North Korea is closest to being planned

## <ins>Classification of goods

### 1. private goods (economic)

-   produced at a cost 💰
-   scarcity (pay a price)
-   excludability (one can be excluded from consuming it through price)
-   rivalry (if one consumes 1 unit, less is left for others), for example: if 1 buys 1 bottle of milk, less bottles are left on the shelves to be purchased 🥛

### 2. free goods (gift of nature)

-   not produced price is charged
-   ex: water, fish 💧🐟

### 3. public goods

-   non excludable
-   non rivalry
-   for ex: radio broadcast 📻

### 4. quasi public goods

-   ex: seaside beach, police forces 🏖️👮

## <ins>Types of goods

### 1. merit goods

-   benefits when produced or consumed
-   ex: education, health care 🧑‍🏫⛑️
-   under-produced/under-consumed
-   government encourages production/consumption with subsidies

### 2. demerit goods

-   negative externalities when produced and consumed
-   ex: drugs, alcohol, fuel 💊🍷⛽
-   over-produced/over-consumed
-   government discourage production/consumption with taxes through excise taxes
