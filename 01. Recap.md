# Seminar 1: Recap of main economic concepts

## The basic economic (the classic economic problem):
- unlimited needs (food, water, shelter, health care, education) 🍔💧
- unlimited wants 

**VS**
- limited resources

---

## Opportunity cost (OC):
the loss of other alternatives when one alternative is chosen.
### <ins>Examples:
1. consumer budget: 7000 RON
   1. <ins>1x Macbook Pro</ins> *(7000 RON)*
   2. 2x Lenovo *(3500 RON/each)* &larr; OC
2. IT company budget: 1 mil. €
   1. <ins>Project B (best profit)</ins>
   2. Project C (moderate profit) &larr; OC
   3. ~~Project A (low profit)~~
    > When we have multiple choices the OC becomes the next best alternative
3. government:
   1. <ins>import vaccine
   2. produce vaccine &larr; OC

## Common questions:

1. What **goods and services** to produce?
2. How to produce these **goods and services**?
3. For whom do we produces **goods and services**?
   - only those who afford to pay the price or everyone?
   - government: redistribute income and wealth (progressive taxation)

## Types of economic systems:
1. market (free) economy:
   - pure: no government at all
   - productive resources are owned by firms
   - consumer sovereignty
   - market forces of **demand and supply**:
     - invisible hand
     - price mechanism
     - high **demand** and low **supply** $\Rightarrow$ **price** $\nearrow$ $\Rightarrow$ signaling that more productive resources should be used to produce more $\Rightarrow$ supply $\nearrow$
   - firms want max profits
   - consumers want max utility
2. Planned (command) economy:
   - government owns most productive resources
   - state enterprises
   - central planners
     - they plan ahead
     - they decide what goods and services (and in what quantities) to produce
     - they set the price for most (basic) goods at low levels
     - low levels $\Rightarrow$ shortages which leads:
       - queues
       - black markets
   - government wants max social welfare
3. Mixed economies:
   - most of the countries are Mixed
   - Singapore is the closest to free
   - North Korea is closest to being planned

## Classification of goods:
1. private goods (economic):
   - produced at a cost
   - scarcity(pay a price)
   - excludability (one can be excluded from consuming it through price)
   - rivalry (if one consumes 1 unit, less is left for others), for example: if 1 buys 1 bottle of milk, less bottles are left on the shelves to be purchased
2. free goods (gift of nature):
   - not produced price is charged
3. public goods:
   - non excludable
   - non rivalry
   - for ex: radio broadcast
4. quasi public goods:
   - ex: seaside beach, police forces

## Types of goods:

- merit goods:
  - benefits when produced or consumed
  - ex: education, health care
  - under-produced/under-consumed
  - government encourages production/consumption with subsidies
- demerit goods:
  - negative externalities when produced and consumed
  - ex: drugs, alcohol, fuel
  - over-produced/over-consumed
  - government discourage production/consumption with taxes through excise taxes
