## Exercise 1
**The case of zero capital mobility ($CF = 0$, BP is vertical)**  
*Consider an open economy:*  
- $C = 2000 + 0.6$, $(y - T)$ 
- $I = 300 - 3000 \cdot r$
- $G = 300$
- $T = 300$
- $NX = 400 - 200 \cdot e$
- $\dfrac{M^S}{p} = 500$
- $\dfrac{M^D}{p} = 0.2 \cdot y - 1000 \cdot r$
> $e$ - nominal exchange rate (foreign currency / domestic currency)

Determine:  
&emsp; (a) the $IS$, $LM$ and $BP$ equations both analytically and numerically  
&emsp; (b) the equilibrium coordinates ($y ^ *$ and $r ^ *$)

---

(a)  

&emsp; $AE = C + I + G + NX$  
> $AE$ - aggregate expenditure

&emsp; $AE = 2000 + 0.6 \cdot (y - 300) + 300 + 300 - 3000 \cdot r + 400 - 200 \cdot e$  
&emsp; $AE = 2820 + 0.6 \cdot y - 3000 \cdot r - 200 \cdot e$  

&emsp; **IS:**  
> At equilibrium on the market for goods and services: $y = AE \Rightarrow y = 2820 + 0.6 \cdot y - 3000 \cdot r - 200 \cdot e$


&emsp; $y = 7050 - 7500 \cdot r - 500 \cdot e$  

&emsp; **LM:**  
> At equilibrium on the money market: $\dfrac{M^S}{p} = \dfrac{M^D}{p} \Rightarrow 500 = 0.2 \cdot y - 1000 \cdot r$

&emsp; $y = 2500 + 5000 \cdot r$  

&emsp; **BP:**  
> BP curve when CF = 0 is also called the BT curve  
> At equilibrium on the external sector: $BP = 0 \Leftrightarrow NX = CF \Rightarrow NX = 0 \Rightarrow vertical BP$  

&emsp; $NX = 400 - 200 \cdot e = 0 \Rightarrow 200 \cdot e = 400$  

---

(b)  
> Since $NX = 0 \Rightarrow e = 2$  
> Substituting into the IS curve gives $y = 7050 - 7500 \cdot r - 500 \cdot \underset{=2}{e}$

&emsp; $y = 6050 - 7500 \cdot r$ **IS**  
&emsp; $y = 2500 + 5000 \cdot r$ **LM**  
> If we solve the system we get:

&emsp; $y ^ * = 3920$  
&emsp; $r ^ * = 28.4\%$  

---

## Exercise 2
**Perfect capital mobility (BP is horizontal), perfect capital mobility**  
*Consider an economy:*
- $AE = 2000 + 0.75 \cdot (y - T) + G - 2000 \cdot r - 400 \cdot e$
- $\dfrac{M^D}{p} = 0.5 \cdot y - 3000 \cdot r$
- $G = T = 200$ (Initially, the government runs a balanced budget)
- $r _f = 0.2$
> $r _f$ - The world interest rates  

---

(a) the government runs a fixed exchange rate regime in which $e = 2$, what level of money supply is required for this purpose?  
(b) assume an increase in government spending of $100\% \Rightarrow \Delta G = 200$, will the effect on output be greater under the fixed exchange rate regime ($e = 2$) or if the government allows the exchange rate to float?

---

(a)  
&emsp; $AE = 2000 + 0.75 \cdot (y - 200) + 200 - 2000 \cdot r - 400 \cdot e$  
&emsp; $AE = 2050 + 0.75 \cdot y - 2000 \cdot r - 400 \cdot e$  

&emsp; **IS:**  
> At equilibrium on the market for goods and services $y = AE$

&emsp; $y = 2050 + 0.75 \cdot y - 2000 \cdot r - 400 \cdot e$  
&emsp; $y = 8200 - 8000 \cdot r - 1600 \cdot e$  

> Since $e = 2$ and we have perfect capital mobility $r = r _f = 0.2$, we get

&emsp; $y = 8200 - 8000 \cdot 0.2 - 1600 \cdot 2 \Rightarrow y ^ * = 3400$  

&emsp; **LM:**  
> At equilibrium on the money market $\dfrac{M^S}{p} = \dfrac{M^D}{p}$

&emsp; $\dfrac{M^D}{p} = 0.5 \cdot \underset{=3400}{y ^ * } ^ * - 3000 \cdot \underset{=0.2}{r} \Rightarrow \dfrac{M^D}{p} = \dfrac{M^S}{p} = 1100$  

---

(b1) (Maintaining a fixed exchange rate of $e = 2$)  
&emsp; $y = 2250 + 0.75 \cdot y - 2000 \cdot r - 400 \cdot e$  
&emsp; $\Rightarrow y = 9000 - 8000 \cdot r - 1600 \cdot e$  

&emsp; $e = 2,\ r = r _f = 0.2 \Rightarrow y ^ { * * } = 4200$  
> $y$ has increased from $3400$ to $4200$ as $G$ also increased by $200$  
> Money supply will also change to maintain $r = r _f = 0.2$

&emsp; $\dfrac{M^S}{p} = \dfrac{M^D}{p} = 0.5 \cdot \underset{=4200}{y} - 3000 \cdot \underset{=0.2}{r}$  
&emsp; $\Rightarrow \dfrac{M^S}{p} = 1500$  
> $\dfrac{M^S}{p}$ has increased from $1100$ to $1500$ as $G$ increased by $200$  
> If capital is perfectly mobile ($r = r _f = 0.2$) and exchange rate is fixed, fiscal policy (increase in $G$) is effective in altering the level of domestic output  

---

(b2) (Using a flexible exchange rate, if $e$ is floating, $y$ is fixed)  
&emsp; $\underset{=0}{\Delta y} = \underset{=0}{\Delta C} + \underset{=0}{\Delta I} + \underset{\not=0}{\Delta G} + \underset{\not=0}{\Delta NX}$  
&emsp; $\underset{=200}{\Delta G} = - \underset{=-400 \cdot \Delta e}{\Delta NX}$  
&emsp; $\Rightarrow 200 = 400 \cdot \Delta e \Rightarrow \Delta e = 5 \cdot e = 2.5$  

> The exchange rate appreciates by $25\%$  
> If capital is perfectly mobile ($r = r _f = 0.2$) and the exchange rate is flexible, fiscal policy will be useless as any increase in $G$ will be upset by the decrease in $NX$ due to the strengthening of the exchange rate

---

## Exercise 3
**Fixed prices, flexible exchange rates, imperfect capital mobility**
*Consider an open economy:*
- $C = 60 + 0.8 \cdot y ^D$
- $I = 200 - 80 \cdot r + 0.1 \cdot y$
- $G = 300$
- $T = 0.25 \cdot y$
- $Tr = 50$
- $Ex = 250 + 100 \cdot e \cdot \dfrac{p _f }{p}$
- $Im = 400 - 50 \cdot e \cdot \dfrac{p _f }{p} + 0.1 \cdot y$
- $p _f = 2$
- $p = 1$
- $\dfrac{M^D}{p} = 0.2 \cdot y - 10 \cdot r$
- $\dfrac{M^S}{p} = 200$
- $CF = -25 \cdot (r - r _f)$ **(net capital outflows)**
- $r _f = 9\%$
